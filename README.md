## Description:
This portfolio was built using React.js and designed with Bootstrap to showcase my web development skills for front end and back end design and implementation. The selected projects are a collection of assignments I created for my coding bootcamp course through the University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education. I have included downloadable copies of my resume and a contact form using emailJS for you to reach out to me. Be sure to check back periodically as I will be continually developing and deploying new content from my professional and personal life.

## Installation:
If you are using the Node.js runtime environment and want to run this app locally clone the repository and run "*npm run start*" from your command line. If you don't have Node installed or want to access my portfolio live click [here.](https://snovelli-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)
